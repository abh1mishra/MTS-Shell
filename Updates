Update 11/5: [other] Added a rubric to the assignment on Blackboard.

Update 11/6: [documentation] Fixed a typo: a reference to an obsolete shell.c was updated to say textproc.c.

Clarification: Yes, if you use "active" to set it to the same buffer that is already active, you should still print the log message.

Update 11/6: [documentation] Fixed a typo: a reference to an obsolete shell.c was updated to say textproc.c.

Update 11/7: [documentation] Removed a misleading phrase from Appendix A regarding the contents of argv[0].  The only thing that argv[0] can contain is the name of the program to execute, or NULL.

Update 11/7, 12:20pm: [handout] Updated Makefile and logging.c  in the project handout. The change has two effects:

Removed some harmless warnings from the build of logging.c.
Changed compiler options so that reaping code can correctly detect resumed/continued status changes.

Update 11/8: [documentation] The example for the "close" instruction was updated.

The original version neglected to include a buffer activation message for buffer 3.
Update 11/9: [documentation] Uploaded the wrong file in the previous upload; uploaded the right one this time.

Clarification: Yes, if you use "active" to set it to the same buffer that is already active, you should still print the log message.

Clarification: The debug output does not affect your project score.

If you think it's useful to you, then keep it.
If it's annoying, you can disable it by looking for the line #define DEBUG 1, and changing the 1 to a 0.
